# jsfx-app-with-node

This is the demo `index.html` app from the base [jsfx repo](https://github.com/loov/jsfx) but using a Node module-ized of the library. [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) is used to convert the Node module back to browser-executable JS.

To build the app, run `npm start` from the command line.

After building the app, use the app by opening `index.html` in a web browser. Clicking the buttons should produce some beeps and boops.
